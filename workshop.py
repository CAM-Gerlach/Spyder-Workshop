# In[1] Importing Libraries and Data

# Third-party imports

# Local imports


# In[2] Exploring Data

# Reading data

# Print size of data 

# Print first 3 rows of DataFrame

# TO DO: Print the last 3 rows of the DataFrame



# In[3] Visualisation

# Order rows according to date

# Order Index according to date

# Drop categorical columns

# Plot Temperature Vs Formatted Date

# TO DO: Plot Temperature (C) V.S the Date using only the data from 2006

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Plot Temperature and Humidity in the same plot

# TO DO: Plot different combinations of the variables, for different years



# In[4] Data summarization and aggregation

# Weather data by year

# TO DO: Create and use a function to get the average
#       of the weather data by month


# In[5] Data Analysis and Interpretation

# Plot Correlations

# Plot Gradients colormaps

# Compute Correlations 

# TO DO: Get the correlation for different combinations of variables.
#       Contrast them with the weather_correlations dataframe


# In[6] Data Modeling and Prediction

# Get data subsets for the model

# Run regression

# Get coefficients

# Plot predicted model with test data.

# TO DO: Using the coefficients predict the temperature for a
#       given level of humidity using the 'predicted_temperature' function
#       available in 'utils'

# Evaluate model numerically
