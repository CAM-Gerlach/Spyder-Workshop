# %% [1] Importing Libraries and Data

# Third-party imports

# Local imports


# %% [2] Exploring the Data

# Reading data

# Print length of data

# Print first three rows of DataFrame

# TODO: Print last three rows of DataFrame


# %% [3] Visualization

# Order rows according to date

# Reset index to restore its order

# Drop categorical columns

# Plot temperature vs. date

# TODO: Plot temperature vs date using only the data from 2006

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Plot temperature and humidity in the same plot

# TODO: Plot different combinations of the variables, and for different years


# %% [4] Data summarization and aggregation

# Weather data by year

# TODO: Create and use a function to average the weather data by month


# %% [5] Data Analysis and Interpretation

# Plot correlations

# Plot gradient colormaps

# Compute correlations

# TODO: Get the correlation for different combinations of variables.
#       Contrast them with the weather_correlations dataframe.


# %% [6] Data Modeling and Prediction

# Get data subsets for the model

# Run regression

# Print coefficients


# %% [7] Predictive Model Testing and Evaluation

# Plot predicted model with test data

# TODO: Using the model, predict the temperature for a given level of humidity

# Evaluate model numerically
